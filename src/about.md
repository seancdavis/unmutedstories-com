    bio: "**Collaborate and listen.** You’ll love me. I’m like 90s rap. I’ve got the
      technical know-how you want, mixed with just enough of that sincerity to let
      you know I care. I’m Tupac’s lyrics over Biggie’s beat. If you don’t get that,
      it’s cool. Let’s say this... “if there’s a problem, I’ll solve it. Check with
      my devs so we can resolve it.”"

    bio: |-
      As a design leader and manager, I've helped build some fantastic teams from the ground up. I've helped lay the groundwork that has helped team members succeed in their goals. I've implemented and managed design processes to ensure products get delivered on time within tight deadlines, and the designers are happy in the process. I've coached individuals to be successful leaders, even when I'm no longer part of the team. I'm delighted to give my legos away because I know I can find another tower to create and build on ([https://firstround.com/review/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/](https://firstround.com/review/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/ "https://firstround.com/review/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/")).

      As a relationship builder, I've built both team and individual relationships that have not only helped the organization with its goals but help ensure smooth partnerships between teammates — even on the other side of the world.

      As an award-winning product designer, I've worked with companies such as Procter & Gamble, Kroger, Toyota, ProScan, and many others.

      I've been invited to speak and share my knowledge and experience with AIGA, IxDA, as well as several companies, colleges, and non-profits.

      strangers—feeling awkward and uncomfortable? I haven’t. I’m the kind of developer
      who loves talking to people. Hearing their stories and understanding what makes
      them tick….Wait…You’ve never met a developer like that? Hi, I’m Sean."
