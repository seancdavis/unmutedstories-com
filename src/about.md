    image: "/website/uploads/member-sean.png"
    job_title: Director of Technology at Ample
    bio: |-
      Sean is a tinkerer and a teacher. He is driven to learn as much as he can as fast as he can, and then pass those learnings onto others who may find them beneficial. A nerd who has dedicated the last decade to building applications for the web, Sean loves spending time helping developers solve problems through blog posts, workshops, or conference talks.

      When pretending to not be a nerd, Sean is still likely learning something new. Perhaps it's baking with his wife and toddler or playing music at a restaurant with his friends. Or maybe it's time to break, be quiet, and take a solo stroll through the woods. Whatever it is, if there's a sandwich and a story, Sean is in.
