  # Code of Conduct

  Ummute is an event-driven community for underrepresented folx to share, listen, and learn.

  We believe we can make the tech space a better place by providing an open and raw storytelling platform. A place to slow down. To take time to listen to the stories that surround us. And to use those stories to better ourselves — our selfs, our careers, and our environments — along with the industry in which we work.

  This Code of Conduct applies to all Unmute spaces, including both online and off. Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of our organizers.

  Some Unmute event spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

  Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

  * Any comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion that causes another person to feel hurt, upset or angry.
  * Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
  * Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names.
  * Unwarranted, uncalled for or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they're not appropriate.
  * Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop.
  * Threats of violence.
  * Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
  * Conscious or intentional intimidation.
  * Stalking or following.
  * Any photography or recording (with or without consent), including logging online activity for the purpose of subjecting someone to aggressive pressure or intimidation.
  * Repeated efforts to disrupt a discussion.
  * Unwanted sexual attention.
  * Social contact that is unwanted or makes others feel uncomfortable, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
  * Continued one-on-one communication after a request to cease.
  * Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
  * Publication of non-harassing private communication.
  * Unmute prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort.

    Our organizers reserve the right not to act on complaints regarding:
  * "Reverse" -isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia"
  * Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."

  ## Reporting

  If you are being harassed by anyone associated with Unmute as a participant or team member, by anyone during a Unmute event, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organizers at [hello@unmutedstories.com](). If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond to you within 24 hours with next steps for mitigation.

  This Code of Conduct applies to Unmute spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Unmute outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all reports that are made honestly and with sincerity of intention of harassment by Unmute members, especially our organizers, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The organizers reserve the right to exclude people from Unmute based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Unmute spaces and behavior towards people who are not in Unmute.

  In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made dishonestly or with intent to cause further harm. The Unmute organizers are not here to explain power differentials or other basic social justice concepts to you. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

  We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Unmute members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

  ## Diversity Statement

  Unmute was created as a safe space to support and further the careers and skills of marginalized individuals in the tech industry. We welcome and encourage everyone, no matter how you identify or how others perceive you, to participate in our space.

  We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification.

  This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Geek Feminism community.
