    body:
      We believe we can make the tech space a better place by providing an open
      and raw storytelling platform. A place to slow down. To take time to listen
      to the stories that surround us. And to use those stories to better ourselves
      — our selfs, our careers, and our environments — along with the industry in
      which we work.

    heading: Frequently Anticipated Questions

      <p>Unmute is a new thing and we can't wait to share it with the world!</p>

      <p>We want to make sure you know what we're all about, so here are the questions with think you'll ask us. If you have any more questions, we're <a href="https://twitter.com/unmuted_stories" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>. Or you can <a href="mailto:hello@unmutedstories.com">email us</a>.</p>
    questions:
      - heading: What is the format?
        body: Each event will be 1-2 hours long and will consist of 1-3
          speakers. Between or after talks, we will break the audience members into small
          groups to reflect on the speaker’s talk and/or share their own stories with
          each other. Think of this like facilitated networking. During this COVID season
          we’re living in, all events will be held virtually until it is otherwise safe
          to gather publicly.
      - heading: Are these the same as conference talks?
        body:
          Yes… and no. Yes, there will be someone sharing their experience. They
          will be different from most conference talks because they won’t be centered
          around a piece of technology or a methodology - they’ll be centered on that
          person, their experience, their story.
      - heading: "I have a story to share! How can I be a speaker? "
        body:
          We’d love to hear it! Email us at [hello@unmutedstories.com](mailto:hello@unmutedstories.com)
          and tell us who you are and what kind of story you’d like to share.
      - heading: Will the audience get to participate?
        body:
          Some speakers may be available for Q&A after their talk. We also will
          have breakout time where we put audience members into small groups to either
          share reflections about the speaker’s story or share their own stories with
          each other.
      - heading: Is there a fee to attend?
        body:
          No, for the time being, all events will be free to attendees. We may host
          bigger events or conferences in the future, which may be ticketed.
      - heading: Are speakers compensated?
        body:
          Given the early stage of our program, we currently have no financial backers
          therefore we are unable to pay our speakers. Eventually, we would like to
          evolve to a sponsorship model wherein our sponsors are able to offset speaker
          fees. So for the time being, we appreciate the gracious donation of our speakers’
          time and stories.
      - heading: Who are you and why are you doing this?
        body:
          Unmute is organized by a merry band of tech enthusiasts and practitioners
          who appreciate the human side of our disciplines and are passionate about
          uplifting the voices of those underrepresented in our industry. Learn more
          about our organizing team [here](https://www.unmutedstories.com/about).
      - heading: Can I sponsor an event?
        body:
          While we don’t have a formal sponsorship, we are open to discussing it.
          For the time being, any donations will be used to compensate our speakers
          and cover our tech costs. Email us at [hello@unmutedstories.com](mailto:hello@unmutedstories.com)
          and let us know you’re interested in becoming a sponsor.
